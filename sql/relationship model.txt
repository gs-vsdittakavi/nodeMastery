Relational DBMS

what is a model :

collection of concepts that you use to descrie data in database

in case of mongo db our concepts were collection, document, key value pair, schema


in case of relational model, our concepts will be table, rows, columns, schema, records

In relationship model we store data in tables. Each table will have multiple rows
and columns. Each table can have a relationship with other tables

properties of a telationship (table):

it is a set of rows and order of the rows does not matter
each row has columns and order of columns does not matter.

each row should be unique - no duplicates allowed

KEY:

key is something with which you can uniquely identify a record(row)
key can be combination of multiple columns.
generally we have ID or email,or phone no as unique key and we call it PRIMARY KEY

generally primary key is single value (eg: employee_id)
but it can be a combination of multiple values (email_id, phone_no);

To link the tables in relation, we have FOREIGN KEY

student table
