we are talking about database

we talk about Data Base Management Systems (DBMS)


// let us imagine the situation to store data some 40 years ago without any DBMS

our options can be excel, txt, or directly on hard disk


students.txt

arun | B | male | 21 | chennai | nodejs
neeharika female 20 hyderabad sql
mayank male 20 hyderabad


courses.txt

nodejs 6May 40 
sql 20May 40
sql 10Mar 25

// if we are storing data in txt files, we have problems of inconsistent data
headache of updating it everytime in an improper way
we have integrity issues

to solve the above problem, we have DBMS coming in

DBMS
|
|-> Relational DBMS - eg: mysql
|
|-> Non relational DBMS - eg: mongodb
